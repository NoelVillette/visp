List of todos
======================

* There is an issue when indexing readonly arrays such as HomogeneousMatrix or RotationMatrix

* Generate documentation for enums
* In classes, generate documentation for: constructors, operators
* Unary and n ary operators
* Exclude get operators for vpArray2D ?
* Parse subnamespaces
  * Be careful of the anonymous namespace: this namespace is only visible in header, so it should be ignored
* How should we handle parameters coming from external APIs ? e.g. realsense2, PCL. Can we interact with other bindings such as of opencv's
* Reimplement a framegrabber tutorial in python, with matplotlib
